About Me
======
I am a Ph.D. student at [RiseLab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) and [Math Department](https://math.berkeley.edu/) at University of California at Berkeley. I am advised by [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/). My research interest lies in randomized linear algebra, optimization and machine learning. In particular I am interested in leveraging tools from randomized linear algebra to provide efficient and scalable solutions for large-scale optimization and learning problems. And I am also working on the theory and application of deep learning. Before joining UC Berkeley, I recieved my B.S. in Math from [Zhiyuan College](http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
